## **Overview** 
Through this project you'll be able to detect lane lines on the road in images and videos by creating Computer Vision process pipeline. 

## **Process pipeline**

 1. Convert the image to grayscale
 2. Blur the image using Gaussian filter
 3. Apply Canny edge detection
 4. Mask the edges detected
 5. Apply Hough transform
